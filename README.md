This was a challenging project designed to help us understand and practice the fundamental React hooks (useState, useEffect) - and as a result React's system of refreshing and reloading its components constantly - as well as passing props through components. The project can be seen below or at the [live version](https://4-geeks-react-timer-counter.vercel.app/)
